    "# Google Top Stories - An exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** This dataset was collected during the pandemic, it contains headlines shown by Google Search.\n",
    "It is organized by year, month, date, hour, in a series of nested folders. The leaf folders contain JSON files with information about Google's top stories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to write first a Python function that takes the name of the folder \"GoogleTopStories\" and stores the content of all the JSON files into a single CSV file. Once you have a CSV file, you can practice your pandas & seaborn skills in analyzing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips and ideas for analysis:\n",
    "1. Use the Python command `os.walk` to iteratively traverse the nested subfolders. Account for hidden files that start with .\n",
    "2. Although the dataset has a column domain, imagine that it doesn't have it and write a function that takes a URL and extracts the domain name from it and saves it in a column. Use the `.apply` method to create the column. Learn how to parse URLs with `urllib.parse`.\n",
    "3. Create a bar chart with the frequencies of the top 10 domains. (Use domains, since 'source name' contains duplicates.)\n",
    "4. Create a heatmap that shows the distribution of domains across the 'story_position' values.\n",
    "5. Create timeseries of unique articles per month by query type. (This is challenging, because it is not using pandas' timeseries.)\n",
